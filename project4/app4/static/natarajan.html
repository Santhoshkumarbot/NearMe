            Natarajan Cricket Academy, established by Indian cricketer Thangarasu Natarajan, is located in Chinnappampatti village near Sankagiri, Salem district. The academy aims to identify and nurture young cricketing talent from rural areas, providing them with professional coaching and facilities. The academy's ground features four pitches—two turf, one concrete, and one matting—along with a gym, canteen, and a mini gallery with seating for 100 spectators. Notable personalities, including cricketers Dinesh Karthik, Varun Chakravarthy, and Washington Sundar, have supported the academy's initiatives. The academy operates as a commercial venture, covering expenses for ground maintenance and staff salaries, while offering free training to existing students and nominal fees for new enrollees.
